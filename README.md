This code was made on my foundation study in UTP

the code will ask the user to guess a word by typing a letter or typing the word.
if the user got 6 wrong letter, the code will draw a hang man and the user will lose.

the code prompt a word from the word files by random chances and the user can add or remove word from the words file. 
if the user lose or win the code will ask wethere the user want to play again or quit.

it a simple code for a beginner level...
